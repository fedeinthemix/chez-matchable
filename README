* Description

This is a library for Chez Scheme providing the portable hygienic
pattern matcher by Alex Shinn [[http://synthcode.com/]].

Note: the catch all symbol '_' has been replaced by ':_' because R6RS
doesn't allow its use as an auxiliary keyword in syntax-case.

* Build

To build the libraries run "make".  By default it looks for a
Chez Scheme binary called "chez-scheme".  If the name of your binary
is different, you can specify it as follows (for all targets):

make CHEZ=my-chez-scheme-bin

To test the build run

make test

Running the tests requires SRFI-78.

* Install

By default "make install" will install the libraries under the prefix
"/usr/local".  You can specify a different installation prefix
directory as follows:

make install PREFIX=/my-prefix/path

This will install all compiled libraries (*.so files) to
$PREFIX/lib/csvX.Y-site, where X.Y is Chez's version.  If in addition
you want to install the source files, use the 'install-src' target.
They are installed in the same directory as the .so files.

* Use

Make sure that Chez Scheme can find the libraries by specifying their
location on the command line (with the appropriate flag), or by
setting the environment variable CHEZSCHEMELIBDIRS.
